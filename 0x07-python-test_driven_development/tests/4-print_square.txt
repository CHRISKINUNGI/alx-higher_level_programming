In this module there is a square printing function ``print_square(size)``.

usage

The function is called with the parameter``size`` which defines how
large the square is to be

::

	>>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
	>>> print_square(1)
	#

::

	>>> print_square(4)
	####
    	####
    	####
    	####

If ``size`` is zero, the function prints nothing.

::

	>>> print_square(0)


Size must be an integer if otherwise a Type error is raised.

::

	>>> print_square("not an int")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an integer

if ``size`` is less than zero, a ValueError is raised.

::

	>>> print_square(-7)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: size must be >= 0

At least one argument must be provided.

::

	>>> print_square()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
